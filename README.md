## :rocket: Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes

You can get the Covid19-Vijay App up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

1. **Install the Flutter SDK & Android Studio. [Instructions](https://medium.com/enappd/install-flutter-on-windows-and-mac-1fd1dde453ba).**

2. **Open Terminal & navigate to the root directory of the project.**

    ```shell
    cd covid19-VijayApp
    ```

3. **Run and launch the build on preferred device.**

   ```shell
   flutter run
   ```

4. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your app is now running on your physical device or emulator. Open the `lib` directory in Android Studio itself and edit `*.dart` files. Hot Reload your changes, and the app will update in real time!

At this point, you‚Äôve got the fully functional Covid19-Vijay App running. For additional information on how you can customize your Flutter Apps, see [Google Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter/) and [HackerNoon Guide](https://hackernoon.com/making-the-most-of-flutter-from-basics-to-customization-433171581d01).
